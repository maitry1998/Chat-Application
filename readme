// Readme file
description of all files:
chat_client.cpp : Code file for the client code
chat_server.cpp : Code file for the server code

client : object / executable file for running mytree program
server : object / executable file for running mytime program

client_config.txt: configuration file for client
server_config.txt: configuration file for server

How to edit the above mentioned configuration files:
please dont change the format, you can change the hostname , port number, but if you change the keywords like servhost: and servport: then connection wont happen. Also, please dont remove the colon.

The example format for client_config is :
servhost: linprog.cs.fsu.edu
servport: 12792
 
here lets say if you want to change the host from linprog.cs.fsu.edu to abc and portnumber 12792 to 1234, it can be done as below
servhost: abc
servport: 1234
Note that space " " between servhost: and abc is necessary. same goes for servport.


The example format for server_config is :
port: 12792
 
here lets say if you want to change the port from 12792 to 1234, you can do it like:
port: 1234
Note that space " " between port: and 1234 is necessary. 

NOTE: I am using c++17

How to run the chat application

GIST : command:
1. scl enable devtoolset-11 bash (make sure you have this enabled if you are running on linprog)
2. make 
3. in one session type ./server server_config.txt and in other session type ./client client_config.txt , Howmany ever number of clients you want, open that many sessions and type ./client client_config.txt. The max limit is 20.
Lets say we have opened the server and we have three clients 

Here below, we have sample realtime output of exchanging chats login , logout and exit among the different clients:

SERVER OUTPUT:
chauhan@linprog8.cs.fsu.edu:~>scl enable devtoolset-11 bash
bash-4.2$ cd cpdp/cpdpproj3
bash-4.2$ make clean
rm -f client server
bash-4.2$ make
g++ -std=c++17 -o client chat_client.cpp
g++ -std=c++17 -o server chat_server.cpp -lpthread
bash-4.2$ ./server server_config.txt
Server is running on the port:12792
Hostname for the server is: linprog8.cs.fsu.edu
One of the clients has exited the application
One of the clients has exited the application
One of the clients has exited the application
^CExiting the chat application!
bash-4.2$ 

CLIENT 1 OUTPUT:

bash-4.2$ ./client client_config.txt 
login user1
chat hey alll
user3 >> hey man
user2 >> whatsapp

exit
You cannot exit if you have not logged out.

Limitations:
1. if the same user is logged in in multipple sessions, the message will be sent in both the sessions
2. if the chat format is wrong like CHAT or chat @    user1 , it wont work, The format has to be chat @username only.

Very Rare errors: 
Very rarely socket bind error occurs (1% probability), In case when you encounter such situation, change the port number in both server_config and client_config. If you get the error server cannot be connected, change the ip address in client config, also if you are logged in from linprog2, give address for linprog2 only. In config file if you give linprog.cs.fsu.edu, it will identify the hostname that you are logged in automatically by using getaddressinfo. 

// assumption
The end user will edit the same port number in both the config files. and write a correct hostname in client config. 

//Scope Of this chat application.
This application supports multi user chat facility.the correct order of flow is
1. login -> chat -> logout or login -> logout
2. chat -> logout
3. logout -> login or logout -> exit

regarding pthread and select()
I have used pthread in server where my thread identifier is &thread and my function that i have called is navigate_taskrunner , this function spawns differnet thread for different clients,i have passed an argument to this thread function, the argument is client scoket id. All individual clients have a thread running for the task runner , this function handles all chat activities. 
I have used select in client, In there, The select in client will wait for reading from the server,so , read_fds is being passed as a set of file descriptors to monitor for readability. and then withe the help of (FD_ISSET(sockfd, & read_fds)) , it keeps track of which socket has recieved the input and delivers the message to that particular user.
